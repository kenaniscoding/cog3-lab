        "### Introduction\n",
        "&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Autoencoders are a type of neural network that are trained to learn a compressed representation of input data. They are used to reduce dimensionality, denoise data, and even generate new data. The goal of training an autoencoder is to minimize the reconstruction error, meaning the difference between the original input and the reconstructed output should be as small as possible. This forces the autoencoder to learn a meaningful and efficient representation of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although reconstructing the data might seem like a trivial matter by simply copying the data forward from one layer to another, this is not possible when the number of units in the middle are constricted. In other words, the number of units in each middle layer is typically fewer than that in the input (or\n",
        "output). As a result, these units hold a reduced representation of the data, and the final layer can no longer reconstruct the data exactly [1]. This general representation of the autoencoder is illustrated in Figure 1.1.\n",
